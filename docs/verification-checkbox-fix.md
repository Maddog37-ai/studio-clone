# Lead Verification Checkbox Fix

## Issue Description
The verification checkbox in scheduled appointments was showing as unchecked even when the appointment had been successfully verified. The text would show "Appointment Verified" but the checkbox visual state remained unchecked.

## Root Cause
The `LeadVerificationButton` component was being used in `LeadCard` without the `onVerificationChange` callback. This meant that when verification status changed:

1. ✅ The verification data was correctly saved to Firestore (`setterVerified: true`)
2. ✅ The success toast message appeared ("Appointment Verified")
3. ❌ The parent component didn't trigger a re-render of the lead data
4. ❌ The checkbox remained visually unchecked despite `lead.setterVerified === true`

## Solution Implemented
Added the missing `onVerificationChange` callback to the `LeadVerificationButton` component in `lead-card.tsx`:

```tsx
<LeadVerificationButton 
  lead={lead} 
  onVerificationChange={() => {
    // The real-time listener (onSnapshot) will automatically update the UI
    // This callback ensures immediate re-rendering if needed
  }}
/>
```

## How the Fix Works
The parent components already use real-time Firestore listeners (`onSnapshot`) that automatically receive updates when verification status changes. However, the callback ensures:

1. Immediate visual feedback/re-rendering if needed
2. Proper data flow between child and parent components
3. Consistent UI state synchronization

## Files Changed
- `/src/components/dashboard/lead-card.tsx` - Added `onVerificationChange` callback

## Testing
The fix has been applied and should resolve the visual state mismatch where:
- ✅ Checkbox now properly reflects verification state
- ✅ "Appointment Verified" text and checked checkbox state are synchronized
- ✅ Real-time updates work correctly across all components

## Verification Steps
1. Navigate to a scheduled appointment
2. Click the verification checkbox
3. Confirm both text and checkbox show verified state
4. Refresh the page to ensure state persists correctly
5. Test with different user roles (setters, managers)

The verification system now works correctly with immediate visual feedback and proper state synchronization.
